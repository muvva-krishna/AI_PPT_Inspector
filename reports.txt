Detected Issues:
- Slides 1, 2, 7: The total financial impact of Noogat varies across slides. Slide 1 and Slide 7 state an impact of '$2M', while Slide 2 claims '$3M saved in lost productivity hours annually'.
  Suggestion: Standardize the financial impact figure to either $2M or $3M across all slides to maintain consistency and accuracy.

- Slides 1, 2, 7: The time saved per slide is inconsistent across slides. Slide 1 and Slide 7 state '15 mins Saved per slide created', whereas Slide 2 claims '20 mins saved per slide created'.
  Suggestion: Ensure a consistent figure for time saved per slide (either 15 or 20 minutes) is used throughout the deck to avoid conflicting data points.

- Slides 1, 2: The stated speed improvement of Noogat is inconsistent. Slide 1 claims '2x faster', while Slide 2 states '3x faster deck creation speed'.
  Suggestion: Standardize the speed improvement multiple (2x or 3x) to reflect the true value proposition consistently across the presentation.

- Slides 3: On Slide 3, the headline states 'Noogat: 50 Hours Saved Per Consultant Monthly', but the sum of the detailed breakdown of time-saving areas (10 + 12 + 8 + 6 + 4 hours) only totals 40 hours per consultant monthly. This creates an intra-slide contradiction.
  Suggestion: Reconcile the headline figure (50 hours) with the sum of the detailed time-saving areas (40 hours). Either update the headline to 40 hours or adjust the individual figures to sum up to 50 hours, providing the basis for the additional 10 hours.

- Slides 1: The sentence '15 mins Saved in lost productivity hours Saved per slide created' on Slide 1 is grammatically awkward and unclear.
  Suggestion: Rephrase the sentence for better clarity, for example: 'Noogat saves 15 minutes per slide created, contributing to reduced lost productivity hours.'


Suggestions:
- Add a specific source for the '$2M Impact' claim on Slide 1 to enhance credibility.
- Include a source for the 'Comparative Time Savings Analysis' on Slide 5, similar to how Slide 7 references 'Noogat Internal Analysis', to support the data presented.
